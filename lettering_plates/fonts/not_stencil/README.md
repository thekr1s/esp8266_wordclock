To stencilize a font i have use:
FontForge https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/

After opening a font dubble click on a letter to start editing
In the upper bar type the letters you want to change

then for eatch letter place a square over the letter(where you want the cutout)
Then Select the letter and not the square (Shift+Click to select multiple points)
